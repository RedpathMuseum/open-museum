        <h1>Australopithecus afarensis</h1>
        <h3>Australopithecus afarensis</h3>
        <p>
          Australopithecus afarensis is an extinct hominid species that was found to have lived between 3.85 and 2.95 mya. The species is perhaps most well-known by the partial skeleton named Lucy, found by Donald Johanson and colleagues near Hadar, Ethiopia in 1974. Remains from over 300 individuals fossils have been discovered in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania.
          Au. afarensis is notably thought to be more closely related to the genus Homo than any other known primate from the same time. Compared to the great apes, the molars and canines found in Au. afarensis are reduced in size, although still larger than found in modern humans. Au. afarensis also has a prognathic face, ie. one with forward-projecting jaws. The braincase contained a small brain, roughly one-third the size of a modern human’s.
          The modified pelvis and femur found in Au. afarensis skeletons, in addition to the loss of climbing ability resulting from the loss of grasping feet, strongly suggest bipedalism. Computer simulations suggest that this hominid was able to walk with an upright gait similar to modern humans.

        <h3>Bipedalism</h3>
        <p>
          Bipedalism, the sustained practice of walking on two legs, is evidenced in skeletons as early as 4 million years ago. It is considered by many to be the defining line between primate and hominid. There are numerous theories on why the trait evolved, most of which center around the adaptation to a hotter grassland environment. These include the need to travel larger distances, the need for increased visibility for predators, and the minimization of the body’s exposure to the sun’s rays.
          In quadrupeds, some manual dexterity must be sacrificed for weight bearing adaptations. Bipeds are therefore free of these limitations, and with the development of wider fingertips in Australopithecus africanus, had increased stability in holding objects such as stone tools. Australopithecus garhi was found proximate, both in location and in time period, to where the earliest Oldowan tools were reportedly located.
